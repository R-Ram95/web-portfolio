          My coding journey began with control systems and PLCs during my time
          as a Mechanical Engineer. The ability to model the real world and
          automate manual tasks was fascinating to me. In 2021, I returned to
          school to pursue a master's degree in software engineering. My
          background in mechanical engineering provides me with a unique
          perspective on problem-solving, enabling me to approach software
          challenges with a structured and analytical mindset.
